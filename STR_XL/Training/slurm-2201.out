. Consider either turning off auto-sharding or switching the auto_shard_policy to DATA to shard this dataset. You can do this by creating a new `tf.data.Options()` object then setting `options.experimental_distribute.auto_shard_policy = AutoShardPolicy.DATA` before applying the options object to the dataset via `dataset.with_options(options)`.
